This is the full stack interview project for Anch.io made by Boris Stankov.

## Technologies used:

front-end: Angular14 

backend: ASP.NET Core 

## Run the project:

To run the project you need to first install **Angular CLI** and **.NET 6.0 SDK** 

angular cli : npm install -g @angular/cli
.NET :  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.403-windows-x64-installer

After that you need to cd anch.Back-end/ and start the backend by typing: 
dotnet run

then you need to cd anch.UI/ and npm install all the node modules as well. 
and after that you need to start the front end as well by typing: 
ng serve --open

this should start both the BE and the FE.
